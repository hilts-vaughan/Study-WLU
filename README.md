>Have you ever wandered around the campus of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, trying to find a spot to sit down during exam time? How about looking for a quiet place for your group to work in the science building?
>You've probably considered doing what many students do: using a free classroom to get some work done. However, you're forced to wonder: is another class going to be using it in a half hour? Ten minutes? Ever been evicted from a classroom just after settling down?
>No more. It doesn't have to be that way.
>Study@WLU allows you to check the schedule for any given room at various points in time and future dates. At a glance, you can check how long a room will be occupied or free for. You'll be able to use a room, confidently knowing a class won't be entering any time soon to disrupt you.

Technology & Other
===========

Study@WLU uses the Ionic Framework, Cordova, AngularJS, and SASS to achieve a great multiplatform application.

All the information is supplied by scraping the LORIS server using an API designed for the task. <a href"https://github.com/hilts-vaughan/wlu-loris-api">Check out the API!</a> 

If you think a similar application would be good for your school, fork me or feel free to setup an instance of the LORIS API for your own school if it's powered by a similar system.
